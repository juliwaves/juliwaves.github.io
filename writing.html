<p>i've been writing my own blog since april 2024. you can read it at <a href="https://juliwaves.com/" target="_blank">https://juliwaves.com/</a>.</p>
<p>i started doing this for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>my mom and dad said i should</li>
  <li>i really love reading other people's blogs. i like peeking into random people's lives and getting solutions to my niche hobby problems. i also like reading reviews of grocery store purchases, usually while i'm eating them. idk, that's what blogs are for in my mind</li>
  <li>i used to have a lot of fun sharing my life + thoughts on social media, but those platforms have gotten really... evil</li>
</ul>
<p>so far, i've written at least one post a month. (except for in march 2025. my excuse is i was out of the country for 2 weeks) </p>
<p>sometimes i struggle with the idea that my thoughts are objectively not interesting or useful. but then i remember that's not really the point</p>
<p>interestingly, my blog gets about ~300 visitors every month. i have never posted about my blog on any public social media channel, so all those visitors are coming from random google searches. that makes me happy, because that's how i find fun blog posts to read.</p>
