<p>community building is an important part of my life. i really care about:
  <ul>
<li>marginalized or underrepresented people in my hobbies.</li>
<li>connecting the amazing people i know.</li>
<li>making shit happen.</li>
  </ul> 
<p>in that vein, i currently run:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MAGICAL in Gaming, a group for alumni of marginalized-gender collegiate gaming clubs</li>
  <li>a wide variety of in-person and online activities for the people in my life. i.e. "i make my friends hang out with me a lot"</li>
</ul>
<p>previously, i ran:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cmgg.studentorg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">cal marginalized genders in gaming</a>, a mar-gen gaming club at uc berkeley</li>
  <ul>
    <li>joined the founding officer board in 2018, became copresident in 2019</li>
    <li>spread the <a href="https://x.com/juliwaves/status/1321625086508494849" target="_blank">good word</a> about marginalized-gender gaming spaces at a college level</li>
    <li>changed my life and met many fantastic people</li>
  </ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/college-game-jam" target="_blank">college game jam</a>, a one-week game jam for college students across the globe</li>
  <ul>
    <li>in college i was like, it's weird that there are no game jams specifically for college students. so my friend and i made one</li>
    <li>82 submissions, 176 teams, 423 registered participants</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
