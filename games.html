<p>i have always wanted to make games. i remember being 17 and thinking "man i wish i knew how to make games." i am 26 now and i still haven't made my first game, but i am REALLY TRYING now.</p>
<p>so far i have taken an introductory programming class, messed around aimlessly in unity, learned how to make 3d art, and written down a lot of game ideas.</p>
<p>i suppose you can watch this space to find out what happens next</p>
